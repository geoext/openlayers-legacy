This is just a legacy build of OpenLayers used in geoext. If you want to use OpenLayers the intended way install the `ol` package.

Build a legacy openlayers version into the dist folder by running `npm run build`.

This package makes the production build ie11 friendly and provides a debug version of openlayers.
